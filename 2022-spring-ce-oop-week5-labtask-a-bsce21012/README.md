## TASKS

### Task A [Marks: 15]
In this task, you are required to create a class Point with the following data members and member functions,<br>

Private Data Members such as: <br>
x,y (integers)<br>

Public inline Member Functions such as:<br>
DefaultConstructor() – It will display “I am automatically called because I am constructor”.<br>
void setXY(int a, int b)  – It will initialize x and y<br>
int getX() – It will return value of x.<br>
int getY() – It will return value of y.<br>
Create object of class in main function and display value of x and y<br>


### Task A [Marks: 25]
In this task, you are required to create a class Operation with the following data members and member functions,<br>

Private Data Members such as: <br>
a,b,add,sub,mul(int)<br>
div(float)<br>

Public inline Member Functions such as:<br>
DefaultConstructor() – It will display “Operation Started”.<br>
void get() – It will take input a and b.<br>
void sum() – It will add a and b store in add and print add.<br>
void difference() – It will subtract a and b store in sub and print sub.<br>
void product() – It will take product of a and b store in mul and print mul.<br>
void division() – It will divide a and b store in div and print div.<br>
Destructor() – It will display “Operation Closed”.<br>

Create object of class in main function and call all member functions


### Additional Functions

Additional function(s) should be written in Functions.cpp and used in main.cpp


### Run command

`make run`  This will run main.cpp executable 



### Notes

- `g++` can be used to compile and link C++ applications for use with existing test harnesses or other C++ testing frameworks.
- You should use C++ standard approach for the development, using g++ extensions is not acceptable

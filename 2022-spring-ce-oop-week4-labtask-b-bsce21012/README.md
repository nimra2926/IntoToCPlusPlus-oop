## TASKS

### Task A [Marks: 15]
Write a program by creating an 'Employee' class having the following functions and print the final salary.<br>
1 - 'SetInfo()' which takes the salary, number of hours of work per day of employee <br>
2 - 'AddSal()' which adds $10 to the salary of the employee if it is less than $500.<br>
3 - 'AddWork()' which adds $5 to the salary of the employee if the number of hours of work per day is more than 6 hours.<br>

### Task B [Marks: 25]
Create a class called 'Matrix'. The Matrix class has the following private data members:<br>
1 - number of rows of matrix<br>
2 - number of columns of matrix<br>
3 - elements of matrix (You can use 2D array)<br>
The Matrix class has public member functions for each of the following:<br>
1 - constructor that initializes the number of rows and the number of columns<br>
2 - get the number of rows<br>
3 - get the number of columns<br>
3 - set the elements of the matrix at a given position (i,j)<br>
4 - adding two matrices.<br>
5 - multiplying the two matrices<br>
You can assume that the dimensions are correct for the multiplication and addition.<br>



### Additional Functions

Additional function(s) should be written in Functions.cpp and used in main.cpp


### Run command

`make run`  This will run main.cpp executable 



### Notes

- `g++` can be used to compile and link C++ applications for use with existing test harnesses or other C++ testing frameworks.
- You should use C++ standard approach for the development, using g++ extensions is not acceptable

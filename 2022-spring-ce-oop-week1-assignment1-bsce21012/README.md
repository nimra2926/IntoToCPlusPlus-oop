        • Submission after due time will not be accepted.
 
 There should be a Report explaining your code and highlighting results. 
 Follow this naming convention for your report RollNumber_Assignment#.pdf e.g BSCE21001_Assignment1.pdf. 


### Part I

Swap Two values using pointer through function named as 'SwapValues'.

    void swapValues ( float *, float * ); 

### Part II

Write a program to swap elements of two arrays using pointers. Both arrays should be of same size. Check the size of both arrays before swapping.

    void swapArrays ( int * , int * , int); 

### Part III

Write a program to reverse the elements of an array using pointers.

    void reverseArrayElements (int * , int);


### Run command

`make run`  This will run main.cpp executable 

`make test` This will run test.cpp executable


### Notes
- `g++` can be used to compile and link C++ applications for use with existing test harnesses or other C++ testing frameworks.

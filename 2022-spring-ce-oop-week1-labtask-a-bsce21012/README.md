## TASKS

### Task A

Write  a  function  resize()  that  takes  as  arguments:  a  pointer  pointing  to  the  array  of  integers, its size, and a new_size. new_size can be any number greater than 0.  This function should change the size of the array. If the new size is greater than the previous one, then insert zeroes in new cells. <br>

### Task B

Write  a  code  that  merges  two  arrays.  Create  two  dynamic  arrays  of  sizes  size_1  and  size_2 respectively.  Take  input  in  these  arrays  from  the  user.  Now  create  a  third  array  of  size (size_1+size_2)  and  insert  all  the  elements  of  both  arrays  in  this  array.  Remove  the  duplicate elements from this array and resize the array to a smaller size. <br>

### Additional Functions

Additional function(s) should be written in Functions.cpp and used in main.cpp


### Run command

`make run`  This will run main.cpp executable 



### Notes

- `g++` can be used to compile and link C++ applications for use with existing test harnesses or other C++ testing frameworks.
- You should use C++ standard approach for the development, using g++ extensions is not acceptable
